      <h2><span>ABOUT</span> US</h2>
   
    <p> The National Institute of Engineering (NIE), one of the oldest private engineering colleges of the country, was started in the year 1946.
        The engineers, professors and other good men who labored to establish NIE are many. 
        Their contribution to the cause of technical education is equally noble, whether it has been large or small, whether by money or service.
        NIE owes it glory to all these Men with a Mission. 
        Among the sixteen eminent founders, three engineers Sri S.Ramaswamy, Retd. Superintending Engineer, Mysore PWD, Sri D.V.Narasimha Rao, Retd. Chief Engineer, 
        Mysore State Railways and Sri T.Rama Rao, Retd. Executive Engineer of Mysore PWD, took lead in establishing NIE, the Temple of Learning. 
        It has completed 69 years of fruitful existence.
